# Stock Market Trend Prediction Using Daily News Headlines

## Mentor
**Dr. Beibei Cheng**  
Applied Scientist at Microsoft

## Description
A machine learning project utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to predict stock market trends (up/down) based on the sentiment and context of daily news headlines. The project used classical NLP methods like Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF, as well as advanced techniques like GloVe embeddings and the DistilRoBERTa large language model (from Hugging Face's Transformers library) for zero-shot classification.

## Objective
To explore the relationship between financial news headlines and stock market movements and build a system capable of predicting trends using state-of-the-art NLP methodologies.

## Key Techniques and Skills

### Data Preprocessing
- Tokenization and cleaning using NLTK.

### NLP Feature Engineering
- Extracted features using:
  - Bag-of-Words (BoW)
  - TF-IDF
  - GloVe embeddings with the Gensim library.

### Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Applied DistilRoBERTa from Hugging Face’s Transformers library for zero-shot classification.

### Custom Deep Learning Models
- Designed and trained a custom LSTM model using TensorFlow.

### Model Evaluation
- Assessed model performance using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score

### Analysis and Troubleshooting
- Conducted critical analysis to identify dataset limitations and recommend improvements.

### Reporting and Visualization
- Presented findings using clear language and insightful visualizations.

## Results
Revealed that the dataset’s scope and relevance were insufficient for reliably predicting stock market trends. Provided recommendations for enhancing dataset quality for future studies.
